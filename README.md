🔧 Configuration

Alpaca API Keys:
Obtain your API keys from Alpaca.
Set your API keys securely by encrypting them before saving them to the database. 
Example:

ALPACA_API_KEY = os.getenv('ALPACA_API_KEY')
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('ALPACA_SECRET_KEY')

Timezone:
The bot operates in US/Eastern time to align with market hours.
Ensure uniform time settings across the Django backend and React frontend.
Display local time for users.

📊 Logs & Monitoring
All bot operations are logged to the database for real-time and historical analysis. You can view:

First Screening: Stocks that passed the initial filters.
Indicator Signals: Buy or sell signals generated by indicators.
Order Status: Confirmation of executed trades or failure reasons.

Error Handling
The bot's performance and errors are tracked in the BotOperations table with detailed status and timestamp logging.
